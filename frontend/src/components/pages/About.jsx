          Hi, I'm Rohan Kumar, a Computer Science Engineer who loves building
          creative and easy-to-use web applications. Iâ€™ve explored many
          technologies and found my strength in full-stack development,
          especially with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
        </p>
        <p>
          This blog website is a testament to my skills in full-stack
          development. Built using the MERN stack, it features a seamless user
          interface, efficient back-end architecture, and a fully functional
          content management system. Whether it's creating dynamic user
          experiences with React or ensuring robust data handling with MongoDB
          and Node.js, this project reflects my commitment to delivering
          top-notch web solutions.
        </p>
